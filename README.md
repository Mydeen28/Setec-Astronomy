What is it
==========

Sometimes you want to give somebody your phone or your tablet - for example to give a Hands-On experience on your App. But these Devices often contain highly sensitive Information ( Your Mail, Notes, Calendar-entrys, ..) 
One often gets nervous whether the one you gave the device is really just doing the thing you expect him to do.
Setec Astronomy counter-acts when certain Packages are used - e.g. email / calendar

How does it work
================

The APP is watching the System-Log for indications that an app is started or brought to foreground. You can configure Actions on these events like killing the app and/or playing a sound. 

Why that name?
==============

A lot of people are asking this - thats why I make one paragraph in this ReadMe about that. The working Title was IntentAlert, but I wanted a better name that is not speaking too directly too much. "Setec Astronomy" is an Anagram of "too many secrets" used in the great movie Sneakers. Here are 3 of my favourite Quotes of this movie:

 #1 Cosmo: There's a war out there, old friend. A world war. And it's not about who's got the most bullets. It's about who controls the information. What we see and hear, how we work, what we think... it's all about the information! 

 #2 Cosmo: The world isn't run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money. It's run by little ones and zeroes, little bits of data. It's all just electrons. 

 #3 Whistler: Anybody want to shut down the Federal Reserve?
